**FAQ**

1. I'm a Stata, not an R guy, but want to learn R. Where to start? 

*Look at the course materials on Moodle, which are not shared here. Alternatively, work through the excellent and accessible "R for Data Science", freely available [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).*

**Course contents**

The rapid growth of the World Wide Web over the past two decades tremendously changed the way we share, collect, and publish data. What was once a fundamental problem for the social sciences - the scarcity and inaccessibility of observations - is quickly turning into an abundance of data. In addition to classical forms of data collection (e.g., surveys, lab or ﬁeld experiments), a variety of new possibilities to collect original data has emerged. The Internet oﬀers non-reactive measurements of behavior and preferences of political and other actors (for example, citizens, representatives, courts, and media). The aim of the course is to provide the technical bases for web data collection methods. Furthermore, we will study state-of-the art applications from the social sciences that exploit the potential of web-based data to tackle both classical and new questions of social science. For the practical part, the course participants are expected to independently design and collect data for own empirical applications. To this end, we will use the statistical software R. Knowledge of R is an advantage but not a prerequisite.
